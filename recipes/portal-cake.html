        <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>Oh, not only did you survive, but you have the nerve to try and bake this cake without completing more experiments. You always were so thoughtful.</p>
              
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>8 medium eggs (6 large eggs)
                <li>5 1/2 ounces granulated sugar</li>
                <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li>3 1/2 ounces all purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 ounces cocoa powder</li>
                <li>3 Tbsp butter, melted</li>
                <li>1 jar morello cherries, stemmed and halved</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, divided</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp cornstarch</li>
                <li>1/4 cup Kirsch</li>
                <li>2 pints heavy cream</li>
                <li>2 cups shaved chocolate</li>
              </ul>
  
            <h2>Steps</h2>
              <ol>
                <li>In a stand mixer, add 8 medium eggs (or 6 large eggs), 5 ½ ounces of granulated sugar, and 2 tsp vanilla extract. Whisk for about 8 minutes. On a piece of parchment paper, sift 3 ½ ounces of all purpose flour and 2 ounces of cocoa powder. Slowly add to whipped eggs and mix with the paddle attachment for about 2 minutes before adding 3 Tbsp of melted butter.</li>
                <li>Oil two cake pans and then line the bottoms with parchment paper and oil that as well. Split batter between the two pans. Place in a 350°F oven for 30 minutes. Set aside and allow to cool completely.</li>
                <li>Strain 1 jar of morello cherries, but save the juice. Stem and cut each cherry in half. Over a medium high heat in a medium saucepan, add your cherries along with ½ cup powdered sugar, 2 Tbsp cornstarch, ½ cup of the cherry juice, and ¼ cup Kirsch. Mix to combine and cook until it all becomes a syrup consistency. Place in a bowl and set aside.</li>
                <li>Remove cakes from cake pans. Cut each cake in half, making 4 total layers of cake.</li>
                <li>In a stand mixer combine 2 pints of heavy cream and 1 cup of powdered sugar. Combine until you have whipped cream. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Place a little whipped cream down to help the cake not slide and then top ½ of the round with some Kirsch followed by whipped cream and cherries. Top with the next cake round along with more whipped cream and cherries. The amount of layers is up to you, I added 3 layers of cake rounds. Once you add your last round, cover the entire cake with whipped cream.</li>
                <li>If you're making chocolate shavings, scrape your knife across the top of a chocolate bar of choice to make it into curly shavings. You can also buy chocolate shavings if you'd prefer.</li>
                <li>Add your chocolate shavings to the entire cake on top of the whipped cream. You may want to use gloves to help with the chocolate melting. Once the cake is completely covered, use a piping bag and whipped cream to make some flower blossoms on top of the cake and top each of those with a cherry.</li>       
                <li>Slice it up, serve and enjoy!</li>
